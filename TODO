 - Should be able to save aversion
 - Make Rails a dependency and then allow it to declare dependencies instead of cache_keys
    
    e.g.

    class Contact
      include Redmemo::Cache

      # should add a after_add and after_destroy callback, should also have an expires_at?
      # should use the Rails.cache method?
      cache_method :group_names, depends_on: :groups

      has_and_belongs_to_many :groups

      def group_names
        self.groups.map(&:name)
      end

    end
